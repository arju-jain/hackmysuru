## Request Walkthrough

### Citizen submits a complaint

1. The citizen opens the React application in a browser.
2. `App.tsx` renders the citizen experience and session-aware navigation.
3. The citizen opens `ReportGrievanceModal.tsx`.
4. The client collects description/category information, GPS/location data where available, and evidence such as an image.
5. The frontend sends the request through `client/src/services/api.ts`.
6. Express receives the request through the complaint route layer.
7. Middleware applies the relevant authentication, RBAC, validation, rate-limit, CORS and error-handling checks.
8. The complaint repository creates or updates the complaint using the configured storage driver.
9. `verificationEngine.ts` evaluates available evidence using EXIF/metadata, geographic consistency, dHash, image-derived features and rule-based signals.
10. `duplicateCorrelationEngine.ts` searches for potentially related or duplicate complaints.
11. The ward service loads `server/data/mysuru-wards.geojson` and performs point-in-polygon lookup against the available 65-ward data.
12. Ward/jurisdiction information is attached when valid location data is available.
13. The complaint becomes available to the applicable officer workflow.
14. The citizen can track status through the tracker interface.
15. Officers inspect evidence, verification results, duplicate relationships and complaint details.
16. Resolution may include remarks and resolution evidence.
17. Follow-through and activity/audit records support lifecycle history.
18. Public map/analytics views expose the backend-approved public information.

### Citizen email OTP login

1. `AuthModal.tsx` requests an email OTP through `api.ts`.
2. `authService.ts` and `otpService.ts` generate and validate the OTP.
3. The configured OTP store is selected: Supabase-backed persistence or an in-memory test store.
4. Resend/Nodemailer SMTP sends the email when configured.
5. The submitted OTP is verified and the authenticated session/token response is returned.
6. The frontend hydrates the session and renders the authenticated experience.

### MCC officer login

1. `OfficerLoginModal.tsx` submits officer credentials.
2. The authentication service validates the credentials.
3. The backend issues the officer JWT/session response.
4. Role-aware middleware protects officer-only operations.
5. The officer dashboard displays the permitted queue and inspection actions.

## Key APIs

The project uses an Express API accessed through the centralized frontend API service. Exact endpoint names should be verified against the active route files before this table is used as a formal API contract.

| Method | Endpoint / route family | Purpose | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | Authentication OTP request route | Request citizen email OTP | Public, rate-limited request |
| `POST` | Authentication OTP verification route | Verify OTP and establish session | Public, rate-limited request |
| `POST` | Officer login route | Authenticate officer credentials | Public login endpoint with controls |
| `GET` | Complaint route family | Retrieve complaints/details | Depends on resource and role |
| `POST` | Complaint route family | Create complaint and submit evidence/metadata | As defined by submission policy |
| `PATCH` / `PUT` | Complaint lifecycle route family | Update status or officer-managed fields | Officer/privileged role as applicable |
| `POST` | Follow-through route family | Record/update follow-through actions | Authenticated role as applicable |
| `GET` | Tracking route family | Retrieve complaint status | Tracking/session policy |
| `GET` | Public analytics/map route family | Retrieve public visibility data | Public, subject to privacy rules |
| `GET` | Evidence/inspection route family | Retrieve verification or duplicate information | Officer/privileged role as applicable |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why this is used |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, TypeScript | Component-based UI, fast build workflow and type safety |
| Styling/UI | Tailwind CSS and project UI components | Consistent responsive interface |
| Frontend API | Centralized TypeScript API service | Keeps request logic centralized |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, TypeScript | HTTP API, middleware and business logic |
| Authentication | Citizen email OTP; officer password/JWT flow | Separate citizen and officer access patterns |
| Authorization | Role-aware backend middleware | Protects privileged operations |

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source & licence | Real or synthetic | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server/data/mysuru-wards.geojson` | Project-bundled Mysuru ward boundary dataset; verify original source/licence before redistribution | Real geographic data, subject to source verification | 65-ward point-in-polygon lookup and jurisdiction resolution |
| Supabase PostgreSQL | Configured project Supabase instance and schema | Runtime application data; deployment policy should distinguish real and test records | Users, complaints, OTP records, activity/audit and follow-through data |
| Supabase Storage | Configured project storage bucket | Runtime evidence files or test fixtures | Complaint images and evidence |
| SQLite database | Local project/test configuration | Local or test data | Local development and test-driver scenarios |
| In-memory stores | Test/runtime process | Synthetic and ephemeral | Unit/integration tests, especially OTP scenarios |
| User-submitted evidence | Uploaded runtime files | Real in production; test fixtures in tests | Metadata checks, geographic checks, dHash, embeddings and verification signals |
| Test fixtures | Test suite resources | Synthetic/test data | Regression and end-to-end validation |

## Security and Trust Boundaries

Current safeguards include a backend API boundary, role-aware authorization, OTP/session controls, validation and rate limiting where configured, repository separation, evidence checks and explainable verification signals. This document does not establish security certification or guarantee immunity from abuse.

## Current Implementation Status and Limitations

| Capability | Current state |
|---|---|
| Citizen portal | Implemented in the current frontend architecture |
| MCC officer portal | Implemented with queue, detail and inspection workflows |
| Citizen email OTP | Implemented when provider configuration is available |
| Officer password/JWT login | Implemented in the officer authentication flow |
| SMS OTP | Scaffold/mock boundary; live provider integration not confirmed |
| Complaint submission | Implemented |
| Evidence upload | Supported when storage is configured |
| Explainable verification | Implemented using metadata, geographic and image-derived signals |
| dHash comparison | Implemented as an image-similarity signal |
| 32-dimensional luminance embeddings | Implemented as an image-derived feature mechanism |

    API --> EMAIL["Resend / Nodemailer SMTP"]
    API -.-> SMS["SMS scaffold/mock"]
    API -.-> LOCAL["SQLite or in-memory driver<br/>local/test configurations"]
```

Typical configuration categories include backend port/runtime settings, frontend API base URL, Supabase URL and credentials, JWT/session configuration, email provider settings, storage bucket configuration, optional external-provider settings and local/test-driver configuration. Secrets must remain outside source control.

## Testing Architecture

```

The project has extensive automated coverage according to the audit summary. The exact test count should be taken from the latest successful test run rather than permanently hardcoded here.

## Architectural Principles

1. Separation of concerns between UI, routes, services, repositories and storage.
2. Repository abstraction to support multiple persistence drivers.
3. No direct frontend-to-database connection in the described architecture.
4. Role-based access separation between citizen and officer workflows.
5. Explainable verification based on inspectable signals and rules.
6. Evidence-aware complaint lifecycle, including metadata, image signals and resolution evidence.
7. Geographic routing support using real ward boundary data.
8. Unit, integration and browser-level testability.
9. Explicit boundaries for unavailable neural classification, mocked SMS and unconfirmed ML features.
10. Production-facing views should use backend/database-backed data and avoid unmarked dummy business records.

## One-Sentence Architecture Summary

CivicBridge is a React 19/Vite frontend backed by a Node.js/Express TypeScript API, repository-based Supabase/SQLite/in-memory data access, citizen email OTP and officer JWT authentication, explainable evidence verification, image-similarity duplicate correlation, 65-ward geographic lookup, follow-through and resolution workflows, and citizen/officer/public visibility interfaces.
