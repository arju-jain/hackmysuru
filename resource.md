## 2. What We Built (one-liner)

**Sub-problem:** `<Routing (SIDE-FLOW) Follow-through | Verification (CORE-PROBLEM) | >`

2. `<Report a blocked drain at the pre-filled boundary location>`
3. `<Observe the routing decision + confidence score>`
4. `<Log in as Staff → see it in the panchayat queue → mark resolved>`
5. `<Open the public ward map → status now shows Resolved>`
